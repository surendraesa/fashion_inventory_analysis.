# fashion_inventory_analysis.

** Overview **
  The project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, covering data extraction, cleaning, analysis, visualization, and reporting. The goal is to transform raw data into meaningful insights using industry-standard tools commonly used in data analyst roles.

  The project showcases skills in Python, SQL (MySQL), Power BI, and data storytelling, with final insights presented through a dashboard and a business-ready report.

**Project Workflow**

       1.Data loading and exploration using Python
       
       2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

       3.Data cleaning and preprocessing

       4.SQL querying on a MySQL database

       5.Interactive dashboard development in Power BI

       6.Insight reporting and presentation creation using Gamma

**Tools & Technologies**

      1.Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn)

      2.MySQL (data storage and querying)

      3.Power BI (dashboard and visualizations)

      4.Gamma (report and presentation creation)

**Key Analysis & Results**

      1.Identified key trends and patterns through EDA

      2.Cleaned and standardized data to improve data quality

      3.Used SQL queries to extract actionable insights from structured data

      4.Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize KPIs and trends

      4.Created a clear, concise report and presentation for stakeholders

      5.The final dashboard and report are designed for both technical and non-technical audiences.

**Power BI Dashboard**

     1.The Power BI dashboard includes:

     2.Key performance indicators (KPIs)
